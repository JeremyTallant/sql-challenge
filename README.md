# Database Revival Project

## Background
Two weeks into my new role as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, I've been tasked with a challenging and exciting project: to reconstruct and analyze the company's employee database from the 1980s and 1990s, using only six remaining CSV files. This project will encompass the full spectrum of my data engineering skills, including data modeling to design the database structure, data engineering to create and populate SQL tables, and data analysis to extract meaningful insights from this historical data. This endeavor not only tests my technical abilities but also provides a unique window into the company's past workforce dynamics.
